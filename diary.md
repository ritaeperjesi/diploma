I applied to do my thesis this semester. Panic.

### 2022.10.29.

I made a plan on how the practical part is going to be working. I realised, that this is how I always worked in architecture school, and thinking on big papers is a lot for efficent than on miro board or anything digital. For me. 

I got very excited about the character, who is just a very simple cube face. I name it R.G., from the RGB. It is supposed to be maybe orange if it’s RG. And it’s a reference to a pixel.

I also came up with a system of how the user interface is going to work, there is always RG’s face on the screen, who doesn’t let you alone. There is a text place for him, and a button/text place for the user. These 3 things should always be there, just changing the size based on function.

I’m thinking a lot if I should go in to the Unity+Vuforia direction or the website+ML5 direction. 

I know how to use Vuforia, and it’s working well for the image recognition part. Having a downloadable app is also not bad. It can be designed only for phone.

At the same time, it would be more easily reachable and open to the public, if it’s a website, with the image recognition working in it. Also, ml5 is being made friendly, p5 is made to be friendly, I like working in these environments more, than in Unity.

I watched Daniel Shiffman’s intro to [ML5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmznx0Q1fP0) and found this trainable [image model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image), which looks promising for the handdrawn drawings and people showing it in bad lighting to the camera.

I also looked at the video about [doodle classifier](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/ml5js-beginners-guide/ml5/9-doodleNet/1-doodleNet) that looks promising. 

Denise suggested for another project [Fungus](https://github.com/snozbot/fungus/wiki/tutorial_videos), which is a thing for unity that creates making text based games very easy, so I quickly looked into that. It looks quite simple. It also looks [customizable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdCAjpQ3iGE) how it looks.
I started a figma page, so I can sketch the UX online.

human language, pseudo code, code, sol lewitt instructions, more free and creative exercises too
same backwards, write code to pseudo code in level 2, same book used twice

### 2022.11.05.
A friend recommended twine for prototyping nonlinear text based stories, so I downloaded it and started to explore. It looks easy to use for making the text logic, not so easy to make it pretty, but it has html, css and javascript as well that can be changed, so there is hope. 

### 2022.11.06.
[twine tutorial to add images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXR4vC7Lmoo)
I made a drawing in my notebook based on a Mondrian drawing, wrote the code for it first on paper, than in openprocessing (I made quite some mistakes first), and started to write the twine tutorial for this exercise. 
I started a google doc for the sketch of the book.

### 2022.11.08.
meeting with Lena. table of content, questions for interview, preselection

### 2022.11.15.
creating preselection questionnaire, checking it with Fanni, who is an expert on doing research

### 2022.11.16.
I bought a good chair in IKEA. It's important to have a good chair to work. 
Meeting with Agustin and Mario, discussing project, painting - learning how to hold the brush
esoteric programming languages

### 2022.11.17.
finalizing preselection questionnaire, sending it for friends to fill in and review

### 2022.11.18.
sending out preselection questionnaire in Creative Code Berlin, Creative Code Budapest groups, and to some specific people

### 2022.11.17-22.
existential crisis of trying to write the first chapter
learning: I need people to be in the same room. The people should be quiet. Unfortunately, Mario left to Switzerland, who is a good quiet person in the room. László stayed, but he always wanted to go to a bar, which I said no to, but wasn't productive on writing unfortunately. 

### 2022.11.22.
I was supposed to meet Lena, but wrote up the meeting time wrongly, so I didn't. I was so stressed about this meeting, suddenly as it didn't happen, my mindset got back to normal mode, which is a relief. 

### 2022.11.23. 
Made a proper plan for the project. I know, it's a bit late.
Finalized interview questions, and trying to lure Meredith into doing the trial interview with me, but he doesn't seem to respond. I tried to select interview people based on responses.
I talked about my thesis with Helin, she suggested a talk by Casey Reas, i found a paper about it, painting as coding. 
I also realised twine alone is not enough, I make a prototype in unity now. Maybe I ask meredith's opinion.
No, I don't make a prototype, as Fungus is not on asset store anymore.
